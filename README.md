UNIT 1 — Period 1: 1491-1607

Topic 1.1

Contextualizing Period 1

Learning Objective: Explain the context for European encounters in the
Americas from 1491 to 1607,

oaag the United States is a synthesis, or combination, of people from around
the world, The first people arrived in the Americas at least 10,000 years ago, A
survey of how these indigenous people lived before the arrival of Christopher
Columbus in the Americas in 1492 provides the context for understanding the
interaction of the Europeans and Native Americans and the impact this had
on both groups, Columbus's first voyage was a turning point in world history
because it initiated lasting contact between people on opposite sides of the
Atlantic Ocean, His voyages, followed by European exploration and settlement
in the Americas, had profound results on how people on every continent lived.
Another landmark change came in 1607 with the founding of the first
permanent English settlement at Jamestown, Virginia. The Jamestown
settlement marked the beginning of the framework of a new nation.

Cultural Diversity in the Americas When Columbus reached the
Americas, the existing cultures varied greatly, partially because of differences
in geography and climate, Each culture developed distinctive traits in response
to its environment, from tropical islands where sugar grew to forests rich in
animal life to land with fertile soil for growing corn (maize), Native Americans
also transformed their environments. For example, people in dry regions
created irrigation systems, while those in forested regions used fire to clear
land for agriculture.

Motives for Exploration The European explorers in the Americas—
first the Spanish and Portuguese, then the French and Dutch, and later the
English—competed for land in the Americas. Some were motivated by desires
to spread Christianity. Others hoped to become wealthy by finding an all-water
route to Asia, establishing fur-trading posts, operating gold and silver mines,
or developing plantations. Europeans often relied on violence to subdue or
drive away native inhabitants.

Transatlantic Exchange Contact between Europeans and the natives of
America touched off a transatlantic trade in animals, plants, and germs known
as the Columbian Exchange that altered life for people around the globe.

< 1/809 > ITEXTUALIZING PERIOD 1 1
Crops originally from America such as corn (maize), potatoes, and tomatoes
revolutionized the diet of Europeans. However, germs that had developed in
Europe caused epidemics in the Americas. Typically, the native population of
a region declined by 90 percent within a century after the arrival of Europeans.

Addition of Enslaved Africans Adding to the diversity of people in the
Americas were enslaved Africans. They were brought to the Americas by
Europeans who desired low-cost labor to work in mines and on plantations.
Africans, like Native Americans, resisted European domination by maintaining
elements of their cultures. The three groups influenced the others’ ideas and
ways of life.

European Colonies Within a century of the arrival of Columbus, Spanish
and Portuguese explorers and settlers developed colonies that depended on
natives and enslaved Africans for labor in agriculture and mining precious
metals. In particular, mines in Mexico and South America produced vast
amounts of silver that made Spain the wealthiest European empire in the 16th
and 17th centuries.

Native American Societies
Before European Contact

The American Indian is of the soil, whether it be the region of forests,
plains, pueblos, or mesas. He fits into the landscape, for the hand that
fashioned the continent also fashioned the man for his surroundings.

Luther Standing Bear, Oglala Lakota Chief, 1933

Learning Objective: Explain how various native populations interacted
with the natural environment in North America in the period before
European contact.

The original discovery and settlement of North and South America began
at least 10,000 and maybe up to 40,000 years ago. Migrants from Asia might
have crossed a land bridge that once connected Siberia and Alaska (land now
submerged under the Bering Sea), Over time, people migrated southward from
near the Arctic Circle to the southern tip of South America. As they adapted to
the varied environments they encountered, they evolved into hundreds of tribes
speaking hundreds of languages, By 1491, the population in the Americas was
probably between 50 million and 100 million people.

Cultures of Central and South America
The native population was concentrated in three highly developed civilizations,

» Between the years 300 and 800, the Mayas built remarkable cities in the
rain forests of the Yucatan Peninsula (present-day Guatemala, Belize,
and southern Mexico).

« Several centuries after the decline of the Mayas, the Aztecs from central
Mexico developed a powerful empire. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan,
had a population of about 200,000, equivalent in population to the
largest cities of Europe.

« While the Aztecs were dominating Mexico and Central America, the
Incas based in Peru developed a vast empire in western South America.

All three civilizations developed highly organized societies, carried on an
extensive trade, and created calendars that were based on accurate scientific
observations. All three cultivated crops that provided a stable food supply,

particularly corn (maize) f “~~ ~ yand potatoes for the Incas.

TOPIC 1.2 NATIVE AMERICAN SOCIETIES BEFORE EUROPEAN CONTACT 3
Cultures of North America

The population in the region north of Mexico (present-day United States and
Canada) in the 1490s may have been anywhere from under 1 million to more
than 10 million.

General Patterns Native societies in this region included fewer people and
had less complex social structures than those in Mexico and South America,
One reason for these differences was how slowly the cultivation of corn (maize)
spread northward from Mexico. The nutrition provided by corn allowed for
larger and more densely settled populations. In turn, this led to more socially
diversified societies in which people specialized in their work.

Some of the most populous societies in North America had disappeared
by the L5th century for reasons not well understood. By the time of Columbus,
most people in the Americas in what is now the United States and Canada
lived in semipermanent settlements in groups seldom exceeding 300 people,
In most of these groups, the men made tools and hunted for game, while the
women gathered plants and nuts or grew crops such as corn (maize), beans,
and tobacco,

Language Differences Beyond these broad similarities, the cultures of
American Indians were very diverse. For example, while English, Spanish, and
almost all other European languages were part of just one language family (Indo-
European), American Indian languages constituted more than 20 language
families. Among the largest of these were Algonquian in the northeast, Siouan
on the Great Plains, and Athabaskan in the southwest. Together, these 20
families included more than 400 distinct languages.

Southwest Settlements In the dry region that now includes New Mexico
and Arizona, groups such as the Hohokam, Anasazi, and Pueblos evolved
multifaceted societies. Many people lived in caves, under cliffs, and in
multistoried buildings. The spread of maize cultivation into this region from
Mexico prompted economic growth and the development of irrigation systems.
The additional wealth allowed for a more complex society to develop, one with
greater variations between social and economic classes.

By the time Europeans arrived, extreme drought and other hostile natives
had taken their toll on these groups. However, their descendants continue to
live in the region, and the arid climate helped preserve some of the older stone
and masonry dwellings.

Northwest Settlements Along the Pacific coast from what is today Alaska
to northern California, people lived in permanent longhouses or plank houses.
They had a rich diet based on hunting, fishing, and gathering nuts, berries, and
roots. To help people remember stories, legends, and myths, they carved large
totem poles. However, the high mountain ranges in this region isolated tribes
from one another, creating barriers to development.

Great Basin and Great Plains People adapted to the dry climate of the
Great Basin region and the grasslands of the Great Plains by developing mobile

ways of living. Nomadic tribes survived on hunting, principally the buffalo,
which supplied their food as well as decorations, crafting tools, knives, and
clothing. People lived in tepees, frames of poles covered in animal skins, which
were easily disassembled and transported. Some tribes, though they also
hunted buffalo, lived permanently in earthen lodges often along rivers. They
raised corn (maize), beans, and squash while actively trading with other tribes.
Not until the 17th century did American Indians acquire horses by trading
or stealing them from Spanish settlers. With horses, tribes such as the Lakota
Sioux could more easily follow buffalo herds. The plains tribes would at times
merge or split apart as conditions changed. Migration also was common. For
example, the Apaches gradually migrated southward from Canada to Texas.

Mississippi River Valley East of the Mississippi River, the Woodland
American Indians prospered with a rich food supply. Supported by hunting,
fishing, and agriculture, people established permanent settlements in the
Mississippi and Ohio River valleys and elsewhere. The Adena-Hopewell
culture, centered in what is now Ohio, is famous for its large earthen mounds,
some 300 feet long. One of the largest settlements in the Midwest was Cahokia
(near present-day East St. Louis, Illinois), with as many as 30,000 inhabitants.

Northeast Settlements Some descendants of the Adena-Hopewell culture
spread from the Ohio Valley into New York. Their culture combined hunting
and farming. However, their farming techniques exhausted the soil quickly, so
people had to move to fresh land frequently. Multiple families related through
the mother’s lineage lived together in longhouses that were up to 200 feet long.

Several tribes living near the Great Lakes and in New York—the
Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Mohawk, and later the Tuscaroras—
formed a powerful political union called the Irequois Confederation, or
Haudenosauanee. From the 16th century through the American Revolution,
this powerful union battled rival American Indians as well as Europeans,

Atlantic Seaboard Settlements In the area from New Jersey south to
Florida lived the people of the Coastal Plains such as the Cherokee and the
Lumbee. Many were descendants of the Woodland mound builders and
built timber and bark lodgings along rivers. The rivers and the Atlantic Ocean
provided a rich source of food

Overall Diversity The tremendous variety of landforms and climate
prompted people in North America prior to 1492 to develop widely different
cultures. While Europeans often grouped these varied cultures together, each
tribe was very conscious of its own distinctive systems and traditions. Not until
much later in history did they develop a shared identity as Native Americans.

proclamation and with unfurled banners.

Christopher Columbus, Select Letters, 1493

Learning Objective: Explain the causes of exploration and conquest of
the New World by various European nations.

U ntil the late 1400s, the people of the Americas carried on extensive trade
with each other but had no connection to the people of Europe, Africa, and
Asia. Similarly, Europeans, Africans, and Asians traded among themselves
without knowing of the Americas. However, starting in the 1400s, religious and
economic motives prompted Europeans to explore more widely than before. As
a result, they brought the two parts of the world into contact with each other,

The European Context for Exploration

While Vikings from Scandinavia had visited Greenland and North America
around the year 1000, these voyages had no lasting impact. Columbus's voyages
of exploration finally brought people into ongoing contact across the Atlantic.
Several factors made sailing across the ocean and exploring distant regions
possible and desirable in the late 15th century.

Changes in Thought and Technology

In Europe, a rebirth of classical learning prompted an outburst of artistic and
scientific activity in the 15th and 16th centuries known as the Renaissance.
Several of the technological advances during the Renaissance resulted from
Europeans making improvements in the inventions of others. For example,
Europeans began to use gunpowder (invented by the Chinese) and the
sailing compass (adopted from Arab merchants who learned about it from
the Chinese). Europeans also made major improvements in shipbuilding and
mapmaking. In addition, the invention of the printing press in the 1450s aided
the spread of knowledge across Europe.

< 8/809 >

Religious Conflict

‘The later years of the Renaissance were a time of intense religious zeal and
conflict. The Roman Catholic Church and its leader, known as the pope, had
dominated most of Western Europe for centuries. However, in the 15th and
16th centuries, their power was threatened by both Ottoman Turks, who were
Muslims, and rebellious Christians who challenged the pope's authority.

Catholic Victory in Spain In the 8th century, Islamic invaders from North
Africa, known as Moors, rapidly conquered most of what is now Spain. Over
the next several centuries, Spanish Christians reconquered much of the land
and set up several independent kingdoms. Two of the largest of these kingdoms
united when Isabella, queen of Castile, and Ferdinand, king of Aragon,
married in 1469. In 1492, under the leadership of Isabella and Ferdinand, the
Spanish conquered the last Moorish stronghold in Spain, the city of Granada.
In that year, the monarchs also funded Christopher Columbus on his historic
first voyage. The uniting of Spain under Isabella and Ferdinand, the conquest
of Granada, and the launching of Columbus's voyage signaled new leadership,
hope, and power for Europeans who followed the Roman Catholic faith.

Protestant Revolt in Northern Europe In the early 1500s, certain
Christians in Germany, England, France, Holland, and other northern
European countries revolted against the authority of the pope in Rome. Their
revolt was known as the Protestant Reformation, Conflict between Catholics
and Protestants led to a series of religious wars that resulted in many millions
of deaths in the 16th and 17th centuries. The conflict also caused the Roman
Catholics of Spain and Portugal and the Protestants of England and Holland to
want to spread their own versions of Christianity to people in Africa, Asia, and
the Americas, Thus, a religious motive for exploration and colonization was
added to political and economic motives.

Expanding Trade

Economic motives for exploration grew out of a fierce competition among
European kingdoms for increased trade with Africa, India, and China. In
the past, merchants had traveled from the Italian city-state of Venice and the
Byzantine city of Constantinople on a long, slow, expensive overland route all
the way to eastern China, This land route to Asia had become blocked in 1453
when the Ottoman Turks seized control of Constantinople.

New Routes So the challenge to finding a new way to the rich Asian
trade appeared to be by sailing either south along the West African coast and
then east to China, or sailing west across the Atlantic Ocean. The Portuguese
realized the route south and east was the shortest path. Voyages of exploration
sponsored by Portugal’s Prince Henry the Navigator eventually succeeded
in opening up a long sea route around South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.
In 1498, the Portuguese sea captain Vasco da Gama was the first European
to reach India via this route. By this time, Columbus had attempted what he
mistakenly believed would’ ia.

< 9/809 >

TOPIC 1.3 EUROPEAN EXPLORATION IN THE AMERICAS 9
Slave Trading Since ancient times people in Europe, Africa, and Asia had
enslaved people captured in wars. In the 15th century, the Portuguese began
trading for enslaved people from West Africa. They used the enslaved workers
on newly established sugar plantations on the Madeira and Azores islands off
the African coast, Producing sugar with enslaved labor was so profitable that
when Europeans later established colonies in the Americas, they used a similar
system there.

Developing Nation-States
Europe was also changing politically in the 15th century.

+ Small kingdoms were uniting into larger ones. For example, Castile and
Aragon united to form the core of the modern country of Spain.

+ Enormous multiethnic empires, such as the sprawling Holy Roman
Empire in central Europe, were beginning to break up. For example,
most of the small states that united to form the modern country of
Germany in 1871 were once part of the Holy Roman Empire.

Replacing the small kingdoms and the multiethnic empires were nation-states,
countries in which the majority of people shared both a common culture and
common loyalty toward a central government. The monarchs of the emerging
nation-states, such as Isabella and Ferdinand of Spain; Prince Henry the
Navigator of Portugal; and similar monarchs of France, England, and the
Netherlands depended on trade to bring in needed revenues and on the church
to justify their right to rule.

Dividing the Americas

‘The Western European monarchs used their power to search for riches abroad
and to spread the influence of their version of Christianity to new overseas
dominions, This led to competition for control of land in the Americas.

Spanish and Portuguese Claims Spain and Portugal were the first
European kingdoms to claim territories in the Americas, Their claims
overlapped, leading to disputes. The Catholic monarchs of the two countries
turned to the pope to resolve their differences. In 1493, the pope drew a
vertical, north-south line on a world map, called the line of demarcation, The
pope granted Spain all lands to the west of the line and Portugal all lands to the
east.

In 1494, Spain and Portugal moved the pope's line a few degrees to the
west and signed an agreement called the Treaty of Tordesillas. The line passed
through what is now the country of Brazil. This treaty, together with Portuguese
explorations, established Portugal's claim to Brazil. Spain claimed the rest of the
Americas. However, other European countries soon challenged these claims.

English Claims England’s earliest claims to territory in the Americas rested
on the voyages of John Cabot, an Italian sea captain who sailed under contract to

England, however, did not immediately follow up Cabot’s discoveries with
other expeditions of exploration and settlement. Other issues preoccupied
England’s monarchy in the 1500s, most importantly the religious conflict that
followed Henry VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church.

Later in the 16th century, England took more interest in distant affairs. In
the 1570s and 1580s, under Queen Elizabeth I, England challenged Spanish
shipping in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Sir Francis Drake, for
example, attacked Spanish ships, seized the gold and silver that they carried,
and even attacked Spanish settlements on the coast of Peru, Another English
adventurer, Sir Walter Raleigh, attempted to establish a colonial settlement at
Roanoke Island off the North Carolina coast in 1587, but the venture failed.

French Claims The French monarchy first showed interest in exploration
in 1524 when it sponsored a voyage by an Italian navigator, Giovanni da
Verrazzano. Hoping to find a northwest passage leading through the Americas
to Asia, Verrazzano explored part of North America’s eastern coast, including
the New York harbor. French claims to American territory were also based on
the voyages of Jacques Cartier (1534-1542), who explored the St. Lawrence

River extensively. < 11/809 >

Like the English, the French were slow to develop colonies across the

Atlantic. During the 1500s, the French monarchy was preoccupied with
European wars as well as with internal religious conflict between Roman
Catholics and French Protestants known as Huguenots. Only in the next
century did France develop a strong interest in following up its claims to North
American land.

Columbian Exchange, Spanish
Exploration, and Conquest

In 1491, the world was in many of its aspects and characteristics a
minimum of two worlds—the New World, of the Americas, and the
Old World, consisting of Eurasia and Africa. Columbus brought them
together, and almost immediately and continually ever since, we
have had an exchange.

Learning Objective: Explain causes of the Columbian Exchange and its
effect on Europe and the Americas during the period after 1492.

Cotumbus’ purpose in sailing westward in the 1490s was to find a sea route to
the lucrative trade with Asia, which had been limited by a long and dangerous
land route. ‘The eventual impact of what Columbus found was of far greater
importance,

Christopher Columbus

As mentioned in the previous topic, 1.3, changing economic, political, and
social conditions in Europe combined to support new efforts to expand.
Exploration across the seas was specifically supported by the improvements in
shipbuilding and in navigation with better compasses and mapmaking. These
factors all helped shape the ambitions of many to explore.

Plans to Reach Asia One of these explorers was from the Italian city of
Genoa, Christopher Columbus. He spent eight years seeking financial support
for his plan to sail west from Europe to the “Indies.” Finally, in 1492, he
succeeded in winning the backing of Isabella and Ferdinand, The two Spanish
monarchs were then at the height of their power, having just defeated the Moors
in Granada. They agreed to outfit three ships and to make Columbus governor,
admiral, and viceroy of all the lands that he would claim for Spain.

After sailing from the Canary Islands on September 6, Columbus landed
on an island in the Bahamas on October 12. His success in reaching lands on
the other side of the ocean brought him a burst of glory in Spain. But three
subsequent voyages across the Atlantic were disappointing—he found little
gold, few spices, and no simple path to China and India.

The Columbian Exchange

Europeans and the original inhabitants of the Americas had developed vastly
different cultures over the millennia, The contact between them resulted in the
Columbian Exchange, a transfer of plants, animals, and germs from one side
of the Atlantic to the other for the first time. These exchanges, biological and
cultural, permanently changed the entire world. Never again would people live
in isolation from the other hemisphere.

Europeans learned about many new plants and foods, including beans,
corn, sweet and white potatoes, tomatoes, and tobacco, These food items
transformed the diet of people throughout Eurasia and touched off rapid
population growth in regions from Ireland to West Africa to eastern China,
Europeans also contracted a new disease, syphilis.

People in the Americas learned about sugar cane, bluegrasses, pigs, and
horses, as well as new technology, such as the wheel, iron implements, and
guns. But while the Columbian Exchange led to population growth in Europe,
Africa, and Asia, it had the opposite effect in the Americas. Native Americans
had no immunity to the germs and the diseases brought by Europeans, such
as smallpox and measles. As a result the native population declined rapidly in
the first century after contact. In Mexico, the native population declined from
around 22 million in 1492 to around 4 million by the mid-16th century.

The Rise of Capitalism

In Europe, population growth and access to new resources encouraged trade,
which led to economic, political, and social changes. The medieval system of
feudalism, a system in which monarchs granted land to nobles in exchange for
military service, declined. In its place rose capitalism, an economic system in
which control of capital (money and machinery) became more important than
control of land. As trade increased, commerce became increasingly important,
and political power shifted from large landowners to wealthy merchants.

One reason trade increased was that Europeans were eager to gain access
to the riches of the Americas, Africa, and Asia. A single successful trade
expedition could make the individual who financed the voyage very wealthy.
However, ocean voyages were expensive and dangerous. One bad storm could
destroy all the ships in an expedition. To finance trade voyages more safely,
Europeans developed a new type of enterprise, the joint-stock company, a
business owned by a large number of investors. If a voyage failed, investors lost
only what they had invested. By reducing individual risk, joint-stock companies
encouraged investment, thereby promoting economic growth.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLUMBUS A GREAT HERO?

When Columbus died in 1506, he still believed that he had found a western
route to Asia. However, many Spaniards realized he had not. Nor had he
found gold and spices. They viewed him as a failure. Even the land that he had

explored was named for sor —— “ **sspucci.

TOPIC 1.4 COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE, SPANISH EXPLORATION, AND CONQUEST 15
Columbus then became more honored. Scholars praised his skills as a
navigator and his daring. He traveled where nobody else had ever dared to
venture. As early as 1828, Washington Irving wrote a popular biography
extolling the explorer’s virtues. The apex of Columbus's heroic reputation was
reached in 1934 when President Franklin Roosevelt declared October 12 a
national holiday.

Since the 1990s, however, historians have become more aware of the
strength and diversity of indigenous cultures and the devastating impact of
contact with Europeans, Asa result, several biographies have revised their view
of Columbus, taking a more critical look at him.

A Fortunate Navigator Some have argued that Columbus was simply at
the right place at the right time. Europeans at the end of the 15th century were
eager to find a water route to Asia. If Columbus had not run into the Americas
in 1492, some other explorer—perhaps Vespucci or Cabot—would have done
so a few years later.

A Conqueror Some revisionists take a harsh view of Columbus, regarding
him not as a discoverer but as a conqueror. They portray him as a religious
fanatic who sought to convert the American natives to Christianity and kill
those who resisted.

Response to the Critics Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. argued that Columbus's

chief motivation was neither greed nor ambition—it was the challenge of the
unknown. Others pointed out that, while Columbus brought deadly diseases to
the Americas, the costs of contact were partially offset by positive results such
as the development of democracy.
Historians will continue to debate the nature of Columbus's achievement. As
with other historical questions, distinguishing between fact and fiction and
separating a writer's personal biases from objective reality are difficult. One
conclusion is inescapable: As a result of Columbus's voyages, world history took
asharp turn in a new direction. People are still living with the consequences of
this interaction.

“Apart from his navigational skills, what most set Columbus apart from
other Europeans of his day were not the things that he believed, but the
intensity with which he believed in them and the determination with
which he acted upon those beliefs. . . .

Columbus was, in most respects, merely an especially active and dramatic
embodiment of the European—and especially the Mediterranean—mind
and soul of his time: a religious fanatic obsessed with the conversion,
conquest, or liquidation of all non-Christians; a latter-day Crusader in
search of personal wealth and fame, who expected the enormous and
mysterious world he had found to be filled with monstrous races inhabiting
wild forests, and with golden people living in Eden,”

David E. Stannard, historian, American Holocaust: Columbus
and the Canquest of the New World, 1992

. According to Stannard, which of the following most accurately

describes the context in which Columbus lived?

(A) Europeans believed they should spread Christianity to people in
other parts of the world.

(B) Europeans viewed their culture and the cultures of other people as
very similar.

(C) Europeans were the wealthiest people in the world and considered
themselves “golden.”

(D) Europeans assumed that a continent existed that they had no
contact with.

Evidence that would modify or refute the view of Columbus expressed
by Stannard in this excerpt would include

(A) statements by Spaniards in the late 16th century who believed that
they should not try to convert people to Christianity

(B) excerpts from letters by Columbus indicating that he hoped his
ventures would make him wealthy

(C) descriptions of Native Americans by other European explorers that
were negative

(D) examples of long-term benefits for people in Europe and Asia that
resulted from the voyages by Columbus

“The New World provided soils that were very suitable for the cultivation
of a variety of Old World products, like sugar and coffee. The increased
supply lowered the prices of these products significantly, making them
affordable to the general population for the first time in history. The
production of these products also resulted in large inflows of profits back
to Europe, which some have argued fueled the Industrial Revolution and
the rise of Europe....

The exchange also had some extremely negative impacts. Native American
populations were decimated by Old World diseases. This depopulation
along with the production of valuable Old World crops . . . fueled the
demand for labor that gave rise to the transatlantic slave trade. The result
was the forced movement of over twelve million slaves from Africa to the
Americas and devastating political, social, and economic consequences for
the African continent.”

Nathan Nunn and Nancy Qian, The Columbian Exchange, 2010

“Most dramatically, the Columbian Exchange transformed farming and
human diets, This change is often so culturally ingrained that we take it
for granted...

Despite the transport of new killer diseases, including the emergence of
deadly syphilis in Europe and Asia, which was linked to trade with the
Americas, the Columbian Exchange eventually allowed more people to live
off the land. These newly available plants and animals led to the single largest
improvement in farm productivity since the original agricultural revolution.
The results of different peoples’ efforts in domesticating and refining crops
over thousands of years were now available and being adopted worldwide?

Labor, Slavery, and Caste in the
Spanish Colonial System

Know ye that | have given permission .., to take to the Indies, the
islands and the mainland of the ocean sea already discovered or to
be discovered, four thousand negro slaves both male and female,
provided that they be Christians.

Emperor Charles V of Spain, colonial charter, August 18, 1518

Learning Objective: Explain how the growth of the Spanish Empire
in North America shaped the development of social and economic
structures over time.

Spanish dominance in the Americas was based on more than a papal ruling
and a treaty, The new empire began with ambitious and skilled leaders in
Ferdinand and Isabella. With its adventurous explorers and conquerors (called
conquistadores) and the labor provided by Indians and enslaved Africans,
Spain rapidly expanded its wealth and power.

Spanish Exploration and Conquest

Feats such as the journey across the Isthmus of Panama to the Pacific Ocean by
Vasco Nuifiez de Balboa, the circumnavigation of the world by one of Ferdinand
Magellan's ships (Magellan died before completing the trip), the conquests of
the Aztecs in Mexico by Hernan Cortés, and the conquest of the Incas in Peru
by Francisco Pizarro secured Spain's initial supremacy in the Americas.

‘The conquistadores sent ships loaded with gold and silver back to Spain
from Mexico and Peru, They increased the gold supply in Spain, making it
the richest and most powerful kingdom in Europe. Spain's success encouraged
other states to turn to the Americas in search of gold and power.

Indian Labor In Mexico and Peru, the Spanish encountered the well-
organized and populous Aztec and Inca empires. Even after diseases killed most
natives, millions survived. The Spanish incorporated the surviving Indians into
their own empire. To control them, the Spanish used the encomienda system
in which Spain's king granted natives who lived on a tract of land to individual
Spaniards. These Indians were forced to farm or work in the mines. The fruits
of their labors went to the Spanish, who in turn had to “care” for the Indians.

19

TOPIC 1.5 LABOR, SLAVERY, AND CASTE IN THE SPANISH COLONIAL SYSTEM

< 19/809 >

Enslaved African Labor On their sugar plantations on islands off the
African coast, the Portuguese had already shown that using enslaved Africans
to grow crops could be profitable. They provided a model for other Europeans.
‘The Spanish, to add to their labor force and to replace Indians who died from
diseases and brutality, began trading with African partners who could supply
enslaved people. The Spanish imported people under the asiento system, which
required colonists to pay a tax to the Spanish king on each enslaved person they
imported to the Americas.

As other Europeans established American colonies, they also imported
enslaved Africans in large numbers. During the colonial era, more Africans
than Europeans crossed the Atlantic to the Americas. Before the transatlantic
slave trade ended in the late 1800s, slave traders sent between 10 million and
15 million enslaved people from Africa, Between 10 percent and 15 percent
died on the voyage across the Atlantic Ocean, called the Middle Passage.

African Resistance Though transported thousands of miles from their
homelands and brutally repressed, Africans resisted slavery in multiple ways.
They often ran away, sabotaged work, or revolted. Further, they maintained
aspects of African culture, particularly in music, religion, and folkways,

Spanish Caste System

The combination of Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans made the
Spanish colonies ethnically diverse. In addition, since most Spanish colonists
were single men rather than families, many had children with native or African
women, The result was that the Spanish colonies included many people with
mixed heritage. In response, the Spanish developed a caste system that defined
the status of people in the colonies by their heritage:

+ At the top were pure-blooded Spaniards.

+ In the middle were several levels of people ordered according to their
mixture of European, Native American, and African heritage.

+ At the bottom were people of pure Indian or Black heritage.

UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP* EDITION
Cultural Interactions
in the Americas

The Spanish have a perfect right to rule these barbarians of the New
World and the adjacent islands, who in prudence, skill, virtues, and
humanity are as inferior to the Spanish as children to adults, or women
to men.

Juan Ginés de Sepulveda, Spanish theologian, 1547

Learning Objective; Explain how and why European and Native
American perspectives of others developed and changed in the period.

H istory is filled with experiences of contact between diverse people, such as
the Romans and Africans in the Classical Era, or the Christians and Muslims
in the Middle Ages, Often these conflicts were violent, but they were in small
regions and lasted no more than a couple centuries, The contact between Native
Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the Americas also featured violence,
but the interaction was on a much larger scale for a much longer time.

Europeans and Native Americans held conflicting worldviews, For example,
most Europeans believed in a single god, while most Native Americans honored
many deities. European women had little role in public life, while Native
American women in some tribes held decision-making positions. Europeans
used legal documents to establish the right to plow a field or hunt in a forest.
Native Americans relied more on tradition to make land use decisions.

European Treatment of Native Americans

The Europeans who colonized North and South America generally viewed
Native Americans as inferior people who could be exploited for economic gain,
converted to Christianity, and used as military allies. However, Europeans used
various approaches for ruling Native Americans and operating colonies.

Spanish Policy

‘The Spanish overwhelmingly subjugated Native Americans. However, Spanish
scholars also debated the status of Native Americans and the treatment of them.

Bartolomé de Las Casas One European who dissented from the views
of most Europeans toward Native Americans was a Spanish priest named

23

TOPIC 1.6 CULTURAL INTERACTIONS IN THE AMERICAS

< 23/809 >

Bartolomé de Las Casas. Though he had owned land and slaves in the West
Indies and had fought in wars against the Indians, he eventually became an
advocate for better treatment for Indians. He persuaded the king to institute the
New Laws of 1542. These laws ended Indian slavery, halted forced Indian labor,
and began to end the encomienda system that kept the Indians in serfdom.
Conservative Spaniards, eager to keep the encomienda system, responded and
successfully pushed the king to repeal parts of the New Laws.

Valladolid Debate The debate over the role for Indians in the Spanish
colonies came to a head in a formal debate in 1550-1551 in Valladolid, Spain.
On one side, Las Casas argued that the Indians were completely human and
morally equal to Europeans, so enslaving them was not justified. On the
other side, another priest, Juan Ginés de Septilveda, argued that Indians
were less than human. Hence, they benefited from serving the Spaniards in
the encomienda system. Neither side clearly persuaded the entire audience.
Though Las Casas was unable to gain equal treatment for Native Americans, he
established the basic arguments on behalf of justice for Indians.

English Policy

Unlike the Spanish, the English settled in areas with no large native empires
that could provide forced labor. Further, when English colonists arrived in the
1600s, European diseases had already dramatically reduced the indigenous
population. In addition, many English colonists came in families rather than as
single young men, so marriage with natives was less common.

Initially, at least in Massachusetts, the English and the American Indians
coexisted, traded, and shared ideas. American Indians taught the settlers how
to grow new crops such as corn (maize) and showed them how to hunt in the
forests. They traded furs for an array of English manufactured goods, including
iron tools and weapons, that they found useful.

But peaceful relations soon gave way to conflict and warfare. Most English
showed no respect for American Indian cultures, which they viewed as “savage.”
American Indians saw their way of life threatened as the English seized land to
support their growing population. ‘The English occupied the land and forced
the small, scattered tribes they encountered to move away from the coast to
inland territories. They expelled the natives rather than subjugating them.

French Policy

The French, looking for furs and converts to Catholicism, viewed American
Indians as potential economic and military allies. Compared to the Spaniards
and the English, the French maintained good relations with the tribes they
encountered. Seeking to control the fur trade, the French built trading posts
throughout the St. Lawrence Valley, the Great Lakes region, and along the
Mississippi River. At these posts, they exchanged French goods for beaver pelts
and other furs collected by American Indians. Because the French had few
colonists, farms, or towns, they posed less threat to the native population than

24 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
did other Europeans. In addition, French soldiers assisted the Huron people in
fighting their traditional enemy, the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee).

Survival Strategies by Native Americans

As European settlements expanded, Native Americans responded to protect
their cultures. One strategy was to ally with one European power or another.
For example, in Mexico, several tribes allied with the Spanish to help them win
their freedom from the Aztecs in the 16th century. Later, in the Ohio River
Valley, the Delawares and the Shawnees allied closely with the French against
English encroachment on their land.

Other tribes simply migrated west to get away from settlers, though this
often led them into conflict with Native Americans already living in a region.
The conflicts reflected the strong tribal loyalty that Native Americans felt.
Since they did not identify as part of a larger group that included all tribes,
European settlers pushing westward rarely faced a unified response from Native
Americans. Only later would the shared desire to resist European power lead
people to identify as Native Americans as well as members of a particular tribe.
Regardless of how they dealt with the European invasion, Native Americans
would never be able to return to the life they had known prior to 1492,

The Role of Africans in America

Africans contributed a third cultural tradition in the Americas, Their experience
growing rice resulted in rice becoming an important crop in the colonies of
South Carolina and Louisiana. They brought musical rhythms and styles of
singing that shaped the development of music throughout the Americas. They
also introduced European settlers to the banjo. By the 19th century, the banjo
would be closely associated with the culture of the southeastern United States.

Europeans justified slavery in many ways. Some cited passages from the
Bible to support their belief that slavery had always existed and was approved
by God. As slavery became exclusively for Africans, Europeans began to argue
that Africans were biologically inferior, so enslaving them was acceptable. This
was similar to the argument used by de Sepulveda regarding Native Americans.

which was very frequently because they are a delicate people unaccustomed
to such work, the Spaniards did not believe them and pitilessly called them
lazy dogs, and kicked and beat them; and when illness was apparent they
sent them home as useless, giving them some cassava for the twenty- to
eighty-league [about 60 to 240 miles] journey. They would go then, falling
into the first stream and dying there in desperation; others would hold

Causation in Period 1

Learning Objective: Explain the effects of the development of
transatlantic voyages from 1491 to 1607.

The reasoning skill of “causation” is the suggested focus for evaluating the
content of this period. As explained in the contextualization introduction to
Period 1, there are many factors to consider in the broad topic of European
encounters in the Americas in the 15th and 16th centuries. One needs to be
able to describe what caused the Native Americans to develop diverse societies
across the enormous and varied lands of North America. This appreciation
of the status of Native Americans during this period will help to explain the
specific developments when the Europeans came to explore what they saw as a
“new world.”

A number of factors had come together to explain the causes of the
European explorations during this particular period. For example, both desires
to spread Christianity and desires for economic gain. However, not all causes
are equally significant. One task of a historian is to weigh the evidence to decide
how much emphasis to place on each of these various causes. Among the most
common differences among historians are debates over whether one cause was
more important than another.

Note that causation implies that an event or development had an effect. The
results of the contact are viewed by some as the Columbian Exchange, which
explain both the short- and long-term impact not only on both sides of the
Atlantic but on people throughout the world. Given the many factors involved,
one can argue as to the historically significant effects on the various peoples
involved on both sides of the Atlantic.

QUESTIONS ABOUT CAUSATION

1. Explain the factors that resulted in various Native American groups
developing their own unique cultures,

2. Explain a significant development in Europe by the 15th and 16th
centuries that caused a surge in exploration.

3. Explain the extent to which the Columbian Exchange had beneficial
effects on both the Native Americans and Europeans.

Topic 2.1

Contextualizing Period 2

Learning Objective: Explain the context for the colonization of North
America from 1607 to 1754,

The period in the Americas from 1491 to 1607 was a time of European
exploration, dominated by the Spanish, In the period from 1607 to 1754,
exploration began giving way to expanding colonization. In North America,
the Spanish, French, Dutch, and British established colonies, with the British
dominating the region from Canada to the Caribbean islands. In particular,
the British established 13 colonies along the Atlantic coast. Most of these
provided a profitable trade and a home to a diverse group of Native Americans,
Europeans, and Africans,

From the establishment of the first permanent English settlement in North
America in 1607 to the start of a decisive war for European control of the
continent in 1756, the colonies evolved. At first, they struggled for survival.
Over time, they became a society of permanent farms, plantations, towns, and
cities. European settlers brought various cultures, economic plans, and ideas
for governing to the Americas. In particular, with varying approaches, they all
sought to dominate the native inhabitants.

Early Settlements

‘The earliest Europeans in the Americas, the Spanish and Portuguese, settled in
Central and South America. The Spanish slowly migrated into North America.
Subsequently, the French, Dutch, and British settled along the Atlantic coast of
North America and gradually migrated westward and developed various types
of colonial systems and relationships with Native Americans.

The first two successful British colonies along the Atlantic coast of North
America were Jamestown and Plymouth. They served as the starting points
that would lead to 13 colonies as far south as Georgia. Depending on the
environmental conditions and settlement patterns, each colony developed
its own economic and cultural system. For many, transatlantic trade was
important, with tobacco, timber, and rice being important products. Trade,
along with ties of religion and language, created strong bonds between the
colonies and Great Britain. However, in the mid-1700s, trade also became a
point of conflict. Colonies increasingly resisted British control over their trade.

2 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
Trade was also the mainstay of early contact between the Europeans and
Native Americans. The colonists wanted a dependable food supply and the
Native Americans were drawn to the iron tools and guns of the newcomers, But
the Europeans generally treated the Native Americans as inferiors to be used
or pushed aside. Trade also led to competition for resources among colonists
and natives. In particular, the British and the French fought a series of wars for
control of land. Native Americans such as the Iroquois and the Huron allied
with Europeans or each other to advance their own interests.

Sources of Labor

As Europeans seized land from Native Americans, they looked for a source of
labor to make the lands profitable. They first tried to enslave Native Americans.
This failed because the Native Americans could escape too easily, Europeans
then tried to employ indentured servants, individuals who agreed to work for
a master for a set number of years (often seven) in exchange for transportation
from Europe to the Americas, Indentured servants became common in the
colonies, but they did not provide sufficient labor for people who owned land.
The British, following the example of the Spanish and others, soon began
importing enslaved laborers from Africa. Given the steady flow of support and
families from Britain, the various 13 colonies gradually developed societies
that both mirrored and varied from British society. From 1607 to the 1750s,
the growth of these 13 British colonies would lead them to use trade and war to
dominate both the Native Americans and the other European colonists,

ANALYZE THE CONTEXT

1. Explain a historical context for understanding the interaction between
the Native Americans and the Europeans as colonies were established in
North America in the period from 1607 to 1754.

if they desire that Piety and godliness should prosper; accompanied with
sobriety, justice and love, let them choose a Country such as this is...
which may yield sufficiency with hard labour and industry.
Reverend John White, The Planter's Plea, 1630

Learning Objective: Explain how and why various European colonies
developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754,

M igration to the Americas during the 17th century and the first half of the
18th century was both influenced by the environment and had a lasting impact
on it. The many different peoples that settled in North America from Europe,
together with the Native Americans already living on the continent and the
enslaved Africans brought there, would ultimately form a society unlike any
previously seen,

Exploration in the new world by Europeans was quickly followed by
colonization. The primary motivations for settling in the Americas in the
17th century were the desires for wealth, to spread Christianity, and to escape
persecution.

Spanish Colonies

Spanish settlements developed slowly in North America as a result of limited
mineral resources and strong opposition from American Indians. Missionary
zeal was an important motivator as Roman Catholic Spain worked to counter
the expanding influence of the Reformation and Protestantism. These colonies
were largely populated by men, and they would gradually include Native
Americans and Africans in their society.

Florida Juan Ponce de Leon claimed these lands for Spain in 1513, After a
number of failures and the strong resistance of American Indians in the region,
the Spanish established a permanent settlement at St. Augustine in 1565, more
than 50 years before the English founded Jamestown. St. Augustine became the
oldest city founded by Europeans in what became the mainland of the United
States. Only a few small settlements developed as the Spanish found little silver
and gold, a declining native population due to wars and disease, and periodic
hurricanes.

4 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
New Mexico and Arizona In a region that had been settled by American
Indians for about 700 years, Spanish colonists began arriving in 1598. They
established Santa Fe as the capital of New Mexico in 1610.

Texas Between Florida and New Mexico, the Spanish established
settlements in Texas, These communities grew in the early 1700s as Spain
resisted French efforts to explore the lower Mississippi River.

California With Russians exploring from Alaska, the Spanish started a
settlement at San Diego in 1769, By 1784, the Franciscan order and Father
Junipero Serra had established missions along the California coast.

French Colonies

Similar to the Spanish, the French colonizers were mainly men. However, there
were few French, Some came as Christian missionaries. Those who came for
economic reasons mostly worked in the lucrative fur trade, traveling throughout
the interior of North America purchasing furs gathered by American Indians.
Many traders married American Indian women, who then provided valuable
services as guides, translators, and negotiators with other American Indians.
‘The reliance of the French on trade made rivers particularly important in their
colonies.
* Quebec, the first French settlement in America was located on the St.
Lawrence River. It was founded by Samuel de Champlain, the “Father of
New France,” in 1608.

In 1673, Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper
Mississippi River. Nine years later, Robert de La Salle explored the
Mississippi basin, which he named Louisiana (after the French king,
Louis XIV),

By 1718, the French had moved southward down the Mississippi River
and established a permanent settlement, New Orleans, where the river
entered the Gulf of Mexico, New Orleans became a prosperous trade
center.

Dutch Colonies

During the 1600s, the Netherlands sponsored voyages of exploration. The
government hired Henry Hudson, an English sailor, to seek westward passage
to Asia. In 1609, while searching for a northwest passage, Hudson sailed up a
broad river that was later named for him, the Hudson River. This expedition
established Dutch claims to the surrounding area, New Amsterdam (and later
New York). The Dutch government granted a private company, the Dutch West
India Company, the right to control the region for economic gain.

Like the French colonies, the Dutch colonies consisted of small numbers
of traders who built strong trade networks among American Indians. However,
the Dutch were more likely to settle in trading posts near the coast or along
major rivers and less likely to intermarry with American Indians.

TOPIC 2.2 EUROPEAN COLONIZATION IN NORTH AMERICA 35

< 35/809 >

British Colonies

In the early 1600s, England was in a position to colonize the lands explored a
century earlier by John Cabot. England's population was growing more rapidly
than its economy, so its number of poor and landless families was increasing.
They were attracted to opportunities in the Americas. Using joint-stock
companies to finance the risky enterprise of colonization, the English began
settling colonies in the Americas.

Compared to other European colonists, those from England included a
higher percentage of families and single females, and they were more interested
in farming. As a result, English settlers were more likely to claim American
Indian land and less likely to intermarry with Indians. In addition, the English
colonies attracted a more diverse group of European settlers than did other
colonies. Most of these settlers migrated in search of better lives or religious
freedom.

The Regions of British Colonies

Liberty of conscience ... we ask as our undoubted right by the law of
God, of nature, and of our own country.
William Penn, The Great Case of Liberty of Conscience," 1670

Learning Objective: Explain how and why environmental and other
factors shaped the development and expansion of various British colonies
that developed and expanded from 1607 to 1754.

The English colonies developed regional or sectional differences based on
many influences including topography, natural resources, climate, and the
background of their settlers. Starting with Jamestown (Virginia) in 1607 and
ending in 1733 in Georgia, 13 distinct colonies developed along the Atlantic
coast of North America. Every colony received its authority to operate by a
charter granting special privileges from the monarch. Each charter described
the relationship between the colony and the crown, Over time, three types of
charters—and three types of colonies—developed:

+ Corporate colonies, such as Jamestown, were operated by joint-stock
companies, at least during these colonies’ early years.

+ Royal colonies, such as Virginia after 1624, were to be under the direct
authority and rule of the king’s government.

+ Proprietary colonies, such as Maryland and Pennsylvania, were under
the authority of individuals granted charters of ownership by the king.

The British took pride in free farmers working the land. Unlike the
French and Spanish colonists, the English had a tradition of representative
government. They were accustomed to elections for representatives speaking
for property owners and deciding important measures, such as taxes, proposed.
by the king’s government. While political and religious conflicts dominated
England, feelings for independence grew in the colonies. Eventually, tensions
emerged between the king and his colonial subjects.

Early English Settlements

The earliest English colonies were founded for very different reasons and
hundreds of miles apart in Virginia and Massachusetts,

38 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP* EDITION
Jamestown

England’s King James I chartered the Virginia Company, a joint-stock
company that founded the first permanent English colony in America at
Jamestown in 1607.

Early Problems The first settlers of Jamestown suffered greatly, mostly
from their own mistakes. The settlement’s location in a swampy area along the
James River resulted in fatal outbreaks of dysentery and malaria, Many of the
settlers were gentlemen unaccustomed to physical work or gold hunters who
refused to hunt or farm. A source of goods came from trade with American
Indians, but conflicts between settlers and the natives stopped trade and settlers
starved.

Through the leadership of Captain John Smith, Jamestown survived
its first five years, Through the efforts of John Rolfe and his Indian wife,
Pocahontas, the colony developed a variety of tobacco that became popular
in Europe and a profitable crop. To recruit White settlers, Virginia provided
50 acres of land, called a headright, to any settler or to anyone who paid for
passage for a settler to the colony. While the headright system helped many
Europeans move to Virginia, it mostly aided landowners who added to their
holdings by sponsoring indentured servants, During the first several decades of
colonization, planters mostly used White laborers, However, by the end of the
17th century, landowners relied more on enslaved Africans.

Transition to a Royal Colony Despite tobacco, by 1624 the Virginia
colony remained near collapse, More than 5,000 people had settled in it, but
death from disease and conflicts with Indians was so high that the population
was only 1,300. Further, the Virginia Company was nearly bankrupt. King
James I finally revoked the company charter and took direct control. Now
known as Virginia, the colony became England's first royal colony.

Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay

About 500 miles to the north of Jamestown, English settlers founded two
other colonies, Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay, in the region that became
known as New England. While many of the settlers in these colonies came
as indentured servants in search of economic opportunity, the distinctive
force that set the tone for these colonies was religious motivation, the search
for wealth. Both were settled by English Protestants who dissented from the
government-supported Church of England, known as the Anglican Church.
The Church of England, lead by the English king, had broken away from the
Roman Catholic Church in 1534. However, it had kept most of the Catholic
rituals and governing structure. The dissenters, influenced by the teachings
of Swiss theologian John Calvin, charged that the Church of England should
break completely with Rome. England’s King James I, who reigned from 1603
to 1625, viewed the religious dissenters as a threat to his religious and political
authority and ordered them arrested and jailed.

TOPIC 2.3 THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIES 39

< 39/809 >

The Plymouth Colony The radical dissenters, the Separatists, wanted to
organize a completely separate church that was independent of royal control.
Several hundred Separatists left England for Holland in search of religious
freedom. Because of their travels, they became known as Pilgrims. Economic
hardship and cultural differences with the Dutch led many of the Pilgrims to
seek another haven for their religion, They chose the new colony in America,
then operated by the Virginia Company of London. In 1620, a small group
of Pilgrims set sail for Virginia aboard the Mayflower. Fewer than half of the
100 passengers on this ship were Separatists; the rest were people who had
economic motives for making the voyage.

After a hard voyage that lasted 65 days, the Mayflower dropped anchor
off the Massachusetts coast, 600 miles north of Virginia, Rather than sail to
Jamestown as planned, the Pilgrims established a new colony at Plymouth,

After a first winter that saw half the settlers perish, the survivors were
helped by local American Indians to adapt to the land. They celebrated a good
harvest at a thanksgiving feast (the first Thanksgiving) in 1621. Strong leaders,
including Captain Miles Standish and Governor William Bradford, grew
Plymouth slowly, Fish, furs, and lumber became the mainstays of the economy.

Massachusetts Bay Colony A group of more moderate dissenters, called
Puritans, believed that the Church of England could be reformed, or purified.
The persecution of Puritans increased when a new king, Charles I, took the
throne in 1625, Seeking religious freedom, a group of Puritans gained a royal
charter for the Massachusetts Bay Company (1629).

In 1630, a thousand Puritans led by John Winthrop sailed for Massachusetts
and founded Boston. Religious and political conflict in England in the 1630s
drove some 15,000 settlers to the Massachusetts Bay Colony—a movement
known as the Great Migration (The same term is used for the movement of
African Americans from southern to northern states in the 20th century.)

Puritans from Massachusetts Bay founded several settlements in New
England. In contrast to the plantations in Virginia, these New England
settlements were mixtures of small towns and family farms that relied on a
blend of commerce and agriculture.

Religious Issues in Maryland

In 1632, King Charles I split off part of Virginia to create a new colony, Maryland.
He granted control of it to George Calvert (Lord Baltimore), a Catholic noble,
for his service to the king. Maryland was the first proprietary colony. The king
expected proprietors to carry out his wishes faithfully, thus giving him control.

The first Lord Baltimore died and Maryland passed to his son, Cecil
Calvert—the second Lord Baltimore. The son set about implementing his
father’s plan in 1634 to provide a haven for his fellow Catholics, who faced
persecution from Protestants in Britain.

Act of Toleration To avoid persecution in England, several wealthy
Catholics emigrated to Maryland and established plantations. However, they

40 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP* EDITION
were quickly outnumbered by Protestant farmers who held a majority in
Maryland's assembly. In 1649, Calvert persuaded the assembly to adopt the
Act of Toleration, the first colonial statute granting religious freedom to all
Christians. However, the statute also called for the death of anyone who denied
the divinity of Jesus.

Protestant Revolt In the late 1600s, Protestants angered by a Catholic
proprietor ignited a civil war. The Protestants triumphed, and they repealed the
Act of Toleration. Catholics lost the right to vote in elections for the assembly.
In the 18th century, Maryland’s economy and society was like that of Virginia,
except that Maryland tolerated more diversity among Protestant sects.

Development of New England
Strong religious convictions sustained settlers in their struggle to establish
the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies. However, Puritan leaders
showed intolerance of anyone who questioned their religious teachings, often
banishing dissidents from the Bay colony, These dissidents formed settlements
that became Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Rhode Island One well-respected Puritan minister who moved from
England to Boston was Roger Williams, who arrived in 1631, He believed
that the individual's conscience was beyond the control of any civil or church
authority. His teachings placed him in conflict with other Puritan leaders,
who ordered his banishment. Leaving Boston, Williams fled southward to
Narragansett Bay, where he and a few followers founded the community of
Providence in 1636, and Williams started one of the first Baptist churches in
America. The government allowed Catholics, Quakers, and Jews to worship
freely, Further, the new colony was unique in that it recognized the rights of
American Indians and paid them for the use of their land.

Another dissident who questioned the doctrines of the Puritan authorities
was Anne Hutchinson. She believed in antinomianism—the idea that since
individuals receive salvation through their faith alone, they were not required
to follow traditional moral laws. Banished from the Bay colony, Hutchinson
and her followers founded Portsmouth in 1638. A few years later, Hutchinson
migrated to Long Island and was killed in an American Indian uprising.

In 1644, Roger Williams was granted a charter from the Parliament that
joined Providence and Portsmouth into a single colony, Rhode Island, Because
this colony tolerated diverse beliefs, it served as a refuge for many.

Connecticut To the west of Rhode Island, the Connecticut River Valley
attracted others who were unhappy with the Massachusetts authorities. The
Reverend Thomas Hooker led a large group of Boston Puritans into the
valley and founded Hartford in 1636. The Hartford settlers then drew up
the first written constitution in American history, the Fundamental Orders
of Connecticut (1639), It established a representative government with a
legislature elected by popular vote and a governor chosen by that legislature.

South of Hartford, a second settlement in the Connecticut Valley was
started by John Davenport in 1637 and given the name New Haven. In 1665,
New Haven joined with Hartford to form Connecticut. The royal charter for
Connecticut granted it a limited degree of self-government, including election
of the governor.

New Hampshire ‘The last colony to be founded in New England was New
Hampshire. Hoping to increase royal control over the colonies, King Charles
II separated New Hampshire from the Massachusetts Bay colony in 1679 and
made it a royal colony, subject to the authority of an appointed governor.

Halfway Covenant To be a full member of a Puritan congregation,
individuals needed to have a confirmed religious experience, a conversion.
However, fewer members of the new native-born generation were having such
experiences. To maintain the church's influence and membership, a halfway
covenant was offered by some clergy so that people could become partial
members even if they had not felt a conversion. Nevertheless, as the years
passed, strict Puritan practices weakened in most New England communities
in order to maintain church membership.

42 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP* EDITION
Restoration Colonies

New American colonies were founded in the late 17th century during a period
known as the Restoration. The name refers to the restoration of the monarchy
under King Charles II in 1660 following a brief period of republican rule under
a Puritan leader, Oliver Cromwell.

The Carolinas

As a reward for helping him gain the throne, Charles II granted a huge tract
of land between Virginia and Spanish Florida to eight nobles. In 1663, these
nobles became the lord proprietors of the Carolinas. In 1729, two royal colonies,
South Carolina and North Carolina, were formed from the original grant.

II. Initially, the southern economy was based on trading furs and providing
food for the West Indies. By the middle of the 18th century, South Carolina's
large rice-growing plantations, worked by enslaved Africans, resembled the
economy and culture of the West Indies.

North Carolina Unlike South Carolina, the region that became North
Carolina had few good harbors and poor transportation. As a result, it
developed few large plantations and little reliance on slavery. It attracted
farmers from Virginia and New England who established small, self-sufficient
tobacco farms. Some made use of indentured servants and enslaved Africans.
North Carolina in the 18th century earned a reputation for democratic views
and autonomy from British control,

The Middle Colonies

The four colonies between New England and Virginia—New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and Delaware—are often called the Middle Colonies. They had
fertile land that attracted a relatively diverse group of European immigrants,
good harbors where cities developed, and tolerant attitudes toward religion.

New York Charles I] wished to consolidate holdings along the Atlantic
coast and close the gap between the New England and the Chesapeake
colonies. This required compelling the Dutch to give up New Amsterdam on
Manhattan Island and the Hudson River Valley.

In 1664, the king granted his brother, the Duke of York (the future James
II), the lands lying between Connecticut and Delaware Bay. James dispatched
a force that easily took control of the Dutch colony from its governor, Peter
Stuyvesant. He ordered his agents to rename the colony New York, but to treat
the Dutch settlers well by allowing them the freedom to worship as they pleased
and to speak their own language.

James also ordered new taxes, duties, and rents without the consent of a
representative assembly. He insisted that no assembly should be allowed in
his colony. Taxation without representation met strong opposition from the
English-speaking settlers. In 1683, James did yield by allowing New York's
governor to grant broad civil and political rights, including a representative
assembly,

New Jersey Believing that the territory of New York was too large, James
split it in 1664, He gave the section located between the Hudson River and
Delaware Bay to Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret. In 1674, one
received West New Jersey and the other East New Jersey. To attract settlers,
both made generous land offers and allowed religious freedom and an
assembly. Eventually, they sold their interests to groups of Quakers. Land
titles in the Jerseys changed hands often, and inaccurate property lines added
to the general confusion. To settle matters, the crown decided in 1702 to
combine the two Jerseys into a single royal colony: New Jersey.

44 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
Pennsylvania, “The Holy Experiment” To the west of New Jersey lay
a broad expanse of forested land that the royal family gave to a military and
political leader, William Penn, in payment for a debt. The land became known
as Penn's woods, or Pennsylvania.

When Penn died, he left the land to his son, also named William Penn.
‘The son had joined a group of Christians who called themselves the Religious
Society of Friends. Commonly known as Quakers, they were considered
radical by most people in Britain and the colonies. They believed that religious
authority was found within each person and not in the Bible nor in any outside
source. This led them to support equality among all men and women and to
reject violence and resist military service. Because their beliefs challenged
authority, the Quakers of England were persecuted and jailed for their beliefs.

Penn hoped his colony would provide a religious refuge for Quakers and
other persecuted people as well as generate income and profits for himself.
He put his Quaker beliefs to the test by enacting liberal ideas in government.
He provided a Frame of Government (1682-1683), which guaranteed a
representative assembly elected by landowners, and a written constitution,
the Charter of Liberties (1701), which guaranteed freedom of worship for
all and unrestricted immigration, Unlike other colonial proprietors, who
governed from England, Penn crossed the ocean to supervise the founding of
Philadelphia on the Delaware River. He brought a plan for a grid pattern of
streets, which was later imitated by other cities. He also attempted to treat the
American Indians fairly and to not cheat them when purchasing their land.

To attract settlers, Penn hired agents and published notices throughout
Europe promising political and religious freedom and generous land terms.
Penn's lands along the Delaware River had previously been settled by several
thousand Dutch and Swedish colonists, who eased the arrival of the newcomers.

Delaware In 1702, Penn granted the lower three counties of Pennsylvania
their own assembly. In effect, Delaware became a separate colony, even though
its governor was the same as Pennsylvania's until the American Revolution.

Georgia, The Last Mainland Colony

In 1732, Georgia, the thirteenth and final British colony between Canada and
the Caribbean, was chartered. It was the only colony to receive direct financial
support from the government. The British had two reasons to start a new
southern colony:

+ They wanted to create a defensive buffer to protect South Carolina
plantations from the Spanish Florida.

+ They wanted a place to send the thousands of people in England
imprisoned for debt. Sending debtors to a colony would both relieve the
overcrowded jails and provide a chance for people to start life over.

Given a royal charter for a proprietary colony, a group of philanthropists
led by James Oglethorpe founded Savannah in 1733. Oglethorpe, the colony's
first governor, put into effect a plan for making the colony thrive. There were

45

TOPIC 2.3 THE REGIONS OF BRITISH COLONIES

<

45/809 >

strict regulations, including bans on drinking rum and slavery. Nevertheless,
partly because of the constant threat of Spanish attack, the colony did not
prosper.

By 1752, Oglethorpe’s group gave up. Georgia was taken over by the British
government and became a royal colony. Restrictions on rum and slavery were
dropped, The colony grew slowly, adopting the plantation system of South
Carolina. In 1776, Georgia was the smallest of the 13 colonies that rebelled
against the British.

Early Political Institutions

Britain had difficulty exerting tight control over the colonies. The distance
across the Atlantic was great enough that communication was slow, Further,
Britain was often consumed by domestic upheavals and wars with France, so
it paid little attention to the colonies. Because of these factors, self-rule began
early in the colonies.

A Representative Assembly in Virginia The Virginia Company
encouraged settlement by guaranteeing to settlers the same rights as residents
of England had, including representation in lawmaking. In 1619, Virginia's
colonists organized the first representative assembly in America, the House of
Burgesses, It was dominated by elite planters.

Representative Government in New England Aboard the Mayflower in
1620, the Pilgrims drew up and signed a document in which they pledged
to make decisions by the will of the majority. Known as the Mayflower
Compact, this was an early form of self-government and a rudimentary
written constitution,

Throughout New England, then, communities held town meetings to
debate local decisions and to elect members to colonial legislatures. Voting
rights were relatively broad for the time. In Massachusetts Bay Colony, all
freemen—male members of the Puritan Church—had the right to elect the
colony's governor and a representative assembly.

Limits to Colonial Democracy Despite these steps, most colonists other
than male property owners were excluded from the political process. Females
and landless males had few rights, indentured servants had practically no rights,
and enslaved people had none. Many colonial governors ruled with autocratic
or unlimited powers, answering only to the king or to those who provided the
colonies’ financial support. Thus, the gradual development of democratic ideas
in the colonies coexisted with antidemocratic practices such as slavery and the
widespread mistreatment of American Indians.

Transatlantic Trade

The sad truth is that without complex business partnerships between
African elites and European traders... the slave trade to the New World
would have been impossible.

Henry Louis Gates Jr, "Ending the Slavery Blame-Game,'’ New York Times, 2010

Learning Objective: Explain the causes and effects of transatlantic
trade over time.

Whit the colonists had various reasons for settling in the Americas, such
as an opportunity to practice their religious faith or an opportunity to search
for wealth, the European nations that controlled the colonies looked at them
to increase their power. A principal way to become stronger was through
transatlantic trade.

Triangular Trade

Merchant ships regularly followed a triangular, or three-part, route, that
connected North America, Africa, and Europe in various ways. A typical
voyage might begin in New England:

+ A ship would leave a port in New England carrying rum across the
Atlantic to West Africa. There the rum would be traded for hundreds of
captive Africans.

+ Next, the ship would set out on the horrendous Middle Passage. Those
Africans who survived the voyage would be traded in the West Indies
for sugarcane.

« Third, completing the last side of the triangle, the ship returned to a
New England port where the sugar would be sold to be made into rum.

Variations on the route included stops in England or Spain. Every trade
provided the slave-trading entrepreneur a substantial profit.

In the 17th century, English trade in enslaved Africans was first
monopolized by the Royal African Company. However, by the late 17th century,
the RAC could not supply as many enslaved Africans as demanded by colonial
planters. Parliament ended the company’s monopoly on the slave trade, and
New England merchants entered the lucrative business.

Mercantilism and the Empire

Most European kingdoms in the 17th century believed in mercantilism, the
economic theory that a country’s wealth was determined by how much more
it exported than it imported. Hence, governments tried to promote the sales
of goods to other countries and to discourage purchases through tariffs. In a
mercantilist system, colonies existed for one purpose only; to enrich the parent
country. They were to provide raw materials to the parent country to promote
that country’s industries. Spanish and French rulers had followed mercantilist
policies from the start of colonization. England began applying them after the
end of the English Civil War in 1651,

Acts of Trade and Navigation England's government implemented a
mercantilist policy with a series of Navigation Acts between 1650 and 1673,
which established three rules for colonial trade:

« Trade to and from the colonies could be carried only by English or
colonial-built ships, operated only by English or colonial crews.

+ All goods imported into the colonies, except for some perishables, had
to pass through ports in England.

50 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
+ Specified or “enumerated” goods from the colonies could be exported
to England only. Tobacco was the original “enumerated” good, but over
the years, the list was greatly expanded.

Impact on the Colonies The Navigation Acts had mixed effects on the
colonies. The acts aided New England shipbuilding, provided Chesapeake
tobacco a monopoly in England, and provided English military forces to
protect the colonies from any attacks by the French and Spanish, The triangular
slave trade that connected the colonies and Africa was largely unaffected by
increased regulations.

However, the acts also severely limited the development of the colonial
economy. Since colonists could not manufacture their own goods, they had
to pay high prices for manufactured goods from England. Since Chesapeake
farmers could sell their crops only to England, they had to accept low prices for
their crops. For example, in the 1660s, low tobacco prices that resulted from
high production brought hard times to the Chesapeake colonies, Maryland and
Virginia. When Virginia's House of Burgesses tried to raise tobacco prices, the
merchants of London retaliated by raising their prices on goods exported to
Virginia.

Besides trading with Great Britain, colonists also continued to trade with
American Indians for furs, food, and other goods, This created ongoing contact
between settlers and the indigenous population, leading to cultural exchanges,
particularly along the western frontier of the colonies. For example, some
Indians adopted Christianity and some colonial men married Indian women.
While intermarriage was uncommon, the resulting couple almost always lived
in the Indian rather than the settler community. The famous marriage between
Pocahontas and John Rolfe in Virginia was a rare exception of an Indian-settler
couple who lived in Jamestown.

Enforcement of the Acts While the theory of mercantilism called
for strict enforcement of trade regulations, the practice was quite different.
England was normally very lax in enforcing regulations, a policy known as
salutary neglect. Several factors made enforcement difficult;

+ The Atlantic Ocean separated the British government from the

colonies, so exerting any authority from London over its distant
possessions was challenging,

« England faced larger problems than regulating trade. Between 1642 and
1763, it was in constant turmoil. It went through the English Civil War,
a revolution that replaced the monarch, and four wars with France.

+ Britain's colonial agents were often corrupt. As a result, colonial
merchants could evade regulations easily with well-placed bribes to
those in charge of enforcing regulations.

In retrospect, regulation might not have been necessary. Because of their
close economic and cultural ties, England and its colonies were natural trading
partners. The colonies had abundant natural resources that they probably
would have sold mostly to the English with or without regulation,

The Dominion of New England

Occasionally, though, the crown would attempt to overcome resistance to its
trade laws, In 1684, it revoked the charter of Massachusetts Bay because it had
been the center of smuggling activity, Whatever economic advantages this and
other efforts brought England were offset by their harm to English-colonial
relations. Colonists resented the regulatory laws imposed by the government
in London. Especially in New England, colonists defied the acts by smuggling
goods from other countries.

A New King A new king, James II, succeeded to the throne in 1685. He
was determined to increase royal control over the colonies by combining them
into larger administrative units and doing away with representative assemblies.
In 1686, he combined New York, New Jersey, and the various New England
colonies into the Dominion of New England. Sir Edmund Andros was sent
from England to serve as governor of the dominion. The new governor made
himself instantly unpopular by levying taxes, limiting town meetings, and
revoking land titles,

Overthrow of the King James II did not remain in power for long as his
attempts at asserting his powers led to an uprising. The Glorious Revolution of
1688 succeeded in deposing James and replacing him with William and Mary.
James's fall from power brought the Dominion of New England to an end, and
the colonies again operated under separate charters.

Ongoing Trade Tensions

After the Glorious Revolution, mercantilist policies remained in force, but the
efforts to enforce them were never sustained enough to be effective. Until 1763,
salutary neglect and colonial resistance to regulation continued, Regulation of
trade, while not the only source of friction, would remain the fundamental
problem between the colonists and England.

Interactions Between
American Indians and Europeans

Fifty-six years after the sailing of the Mayflower, the Pilgrims’ children
had not only defeated the Pokanokets ... they had taken conscious,
methodical measures to purge the land of its people.

Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War, 2006

Learning Objective: Explain how and why interactions between various
European nations and American Indians changed over time,

From the very beginning Europeans saw each other as rivals for power in the
Americas. In general, they viewed American Indians as inferior people who
could be used as forced labors or pushed off their land, but also as potential
allies in conflicts with other Europeans or other American Indians.

In response, Native Americans who survived the devastation of European
diseases defended themselves and their cultures. Sometimes various tribes
joined together to resist Europeans. Other times, a particular tribe allied
with one group of Europeans to fight another or to fight against a traditional
tribal rival. For example, in 1626 in southern New York, the Mahican Indians
persuaded Dutch settlers to join in an attack on the Mohawk Indians.

Conflict in New England

In the 1640s, the New England colonies faced the constant threat of attack from
American Indians, the Dutch, and the French. With England in the midst of a
civil war, the colonists expected little assistance.

New England Confederation In 1643, four New England colonies
(Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New Haven) organized for
their mutual protection. They formed a military alliance known as the New
England Confederation, The confederation was directed by a board composed
of two representatives from each colony. It had limited powers to act on boundary
disputes, the return of runaway servants, and dealings with American Indians.

The confederation lasted until 1684, when colonial rivalries and renewed
control by the English monarch brought this first experiment in colonial
cooperation to an end. Though it lasted only four decades, it established an

aportant precedent for colonies taking unified action for a common purpose.

54 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP* EDITION
Metacom’s War (King Philip’s War) Only a few years before the
confederation’s demise, it helped the New England colonists win a vicious war.
In response to English settlers encroaching on the American Indians’ lands,
a chief of the Wampanoag, Metacom, known to the colonists as King Philip,
united many tribes in southern New England, Some tribes, such as the Mohegans
and the Pequots, supported the colonists because of their long-standing rivalry
with the Wampanoag. The resulting conflict was called Metacom’s War (1675-
1676). In it, several villages were burned to the ground, hundreds of people
were killed, and thousands of people were injured. Eventually, the colonial
forces and their Indian allies prevailed, killing Metacom and ending most
American Indian resistance in New England.

Conflict in Virginia

Sir William Berkeley, the royal governor of Virginia (1641-1652; 1660-
1677), used dictatorial powers to govern on behalf of the large planters. He
antagonized small farmers on Virginia's western frontier because he failed to
protect them from Indian attacks,

Bacon's Rebellion Nathaniel Bacon, an impoverished gentleman farmer,
seized upon the grievances of the western farmers to lead a rebellion against
Berkeley's government. Bacon and others resented the control exercised by a
few large planters in the Chesapeake area. He raised an army of volunteers and,
in 1676, conducted a series of raids and massacres against American Indian
villages on the frontier, including some who had friendly relationships with the
colonial government. Berkeley's government in Jamestown accused Bacon of
rebelling against royal authority. Bacon's army defeated the governor's forces
and burned the Jamestown settlement, Soon afterward, Bacon died of dysentery,
and the rebel army collapsed. Governor Berkeley suppressed the remnants of
the insurrection, executing 23 rebels.

TOPIC 2.5 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMERICAN INDIANS AND EUROPEANS 55

Lasting Problems Though it was short-lived, Bacon's Rebellion, or the
Chesapeake Revolution, highlighted long-lasting disputes in Virginia and most
of the colonies:

« sharp class differences between the wealthy and landless or poor
farmers

* conflict on the frontiers between settlers and American Indians
« colonial resistance to royal control

These problems would continue into the next century, even after conditions
in the Chesapeake and other colonies became more stable and prosperous,

Spanish Rule and the Pueblo Revolt

Spain’s economic policy for its colonies was based on forcing Native Americans
to labor for them through the encomienda system (see Topic 1.5). In religion,
Spain’s Roman Catholic missionaries followed an aggressive, sometimes
harsh, program to convert Native Americans to Christianity. The pressure
of these efforts led to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680. Various tribes of Pueblo
Indians, including the Hopi and Zuni, united against the Spanish. Hundreds
of people died in the fighting, and the Spanish were driven from the area until
1692, However, after the Spanish regained control in 1692, they made some
accommodations to the American Indians in the region. By ruling less harshly,
the Spanish found greater stability.

Slavery in the British Colonies

In every human Breast, God has implanted a Principle,
which we call Love of Freedom.
Phillis Wheatley, “A Principle Which We Call Love of Freedom,’ 1774

Learning Objective 1; Explain the causes and effects of slavery in the
various British colonial regions.

Learning Objective 2: Explain how enslaved people responded to
slavery.

Wit the colonial emphasis on agriculture came a demand for labor. Since
the Native Americans could escape too easily and the supply of indentured
servants was too small, landowners looked for another source of workers. They
turned to the labor of enslaved Africans, especially in the southern colonies.
The transatlantic slave trade (see Topic 2.4) was important to the economy,
and much of the trade was financed or conducted by people in the northern
colonies.

Demand for Labor

In Maryland and Virginia, landowners saw great opportunities for profit because
of the European demand for tobacco, They could get land by taking it or trading
for it from the American Indians. But they could not find enough laborers
willing to work for low wages. The high death rate from disease, food shortages,
and battles with American Indians meant that the population of colonists grew
slowly. Landowners tried several ways to find the workers they wanted.

Indentured Servants The early colonists of the Virginia Company were
struggling to survive and too poor to purchase enslaved Africans as the owners
of sugar plantations in the West Indies did. Instead, the Virginia Company
hoped to meet the desire for labor using indentured servants. Under contract
with a master or landowner who paid for their passage, those from the British
Isles agreed to work for a specified period—usually four to seven years—in
return for room and board. Indentured servants were under the absolute rule
of their masters until the end of their work period. At the end of that period,
they gained their freedom and could work for wages or obtain land of their
own. For landowners, the system provided laborers, but only temporarily.

TOPIC 2.6 SLAVERY IN THE BRITISH COLONIES 59

<

59/809 >

Headright System Virginia attempted to attract immigrants through
offers of land. It offered 50 acres of land to each immigrant who paid for his
own passage and to any plantation owner who paid for an immigrant’s passage.

The Institution of Slavery

In 1619, an English ship serving the Dutch government sold an unusual group
of about 25 indentured servants to Virginia: the servants were Black Africans.
These first Africans in Virginia were not in life bondage, and children born
to them were free. However, this soon changed. By the end of the 1660s, the
Virginia House of Burgesses enacted laws that kept Africans and their offspring
in permanent bondage. They were enslaved.

By the early 18th century, the number of enslaved people and laws to
control them had greatly expanded. All British colonies included at least some
enslaved laborers. The fewest were in New England, where small farmers
had little demand for additional workers. More were in the Middle Colonies,
particularly in the port cities, where African Americans often worked loading
and unloading ships and as sailors, Most were in the southern colonies, working
on plantations. By 1750, half of Virginia's population and two-thirds of South
Carolina's population were enslaved.

The British colonies with the highest number of enslaved people were the
West Indian sugar islands, During the course of American slavery, about 95
percent of enslaved Africans were delivered to the West Indies or Brazil. Less
than 5 percent went to the British colonies in North America.

Increased Demand for Enslaved Africans Several factors explain why
slavery became increasingly important, especially in the southern colonies:

* Reduced migration: Increases in wages in England reduced the supply of
immigrants to the colonies.

+ Dependable workforce: Large plantation owners were disturbed by the
political demands of small farmers and indentured servants and by the
disorders of Bacon's Rebellion (see Topic 2.5). They thought that slavery
would provide a stable labor force totally under their control.

+ Low-cost labor: As tobacco prices fell (see Topic 2.4), rice and indigo
became the most profitable crops. To grow such crops required a large
land area and many inexpensive, relatively unskilled field hands.

This increased demand also supported the active, profitable, and ruthless
triangular trade (see Topic 2.4).

Slave Laws As the number of enslaved workers increased, White colonists
adopted laws to ensure that they would be held in bondage for life and that
slave status would be inherited. In 1641, Massachusetts became the first colony
to recognize the enslavement of “lawful” captives. Virginia in 1661 enacted
legislation that children automatically inherited their mother’s enslaved status
for life. By 1664, the English law that people baptized as Christians could not be
enslaved was being overturned. Maryland declared that baptism did not affect

60 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
the enslaved person's status and that White women could not marry African
American men. As slavery became common, Whites began to regard all Blacks
as inferior. Racism and slavery evolved into integral parts of colonial society.

Resistance to Slavery Although very difficult, many Africans challenged
enslavement. They struggled to maintain family ties, even though slaveowners
could break up a family by selling off a husband or a wife or a child at any time.
Even as many adopted Christianity, they kept elements of the African religious
practices they had brought with them, They used songs and storytelling to
maintain traditions and customs. They resisted slavery through direct action
such as going on hunger strikes, breaking tools, refusing to work, or fleeing—
even if they knew they would likely be caught and punished harshly, The owners’
concern over slave resistance was reflected over the years in the enactment of
new laws to control them.

Jonathan Edwards, The Freedom of Will, 1754

Learning Objective 1: Explain how and why the movement of a variety
of people and ideas across the Atlantic contributed to the development of
American culture over time.

Learning Objective 2: Explain how and why the different goals and
interests of European leaders and colonists affected how they viewed
themselves and their relationship with Britain,

The struggling English colonial villages at the start of the 17th century
evolved by the middle of the 18th century to develop a culture distinct from
any in Europe. If Americans in the 18th century constituted a new kind of
society, what were its characteristics and what forces shaped its “new people”?

Population Growth

In 1701, the English colonies on the Atlantic coast consisted of barely 250,000
Europeans and Africans. By 1775, the population was 2,500,000 people. Among
African Americans, the increase was more dramatic: from about 28,000 in
1701 to 500,000 in 1775, The spectacular gains in population resulted from two
factors: immigration of almost 1 million people and a sharp natural increase,
caused by a high birthrate among colonial families. An abundance of fertile
land and a dependable food supply attracted thousands of Europeans and
supported the raising of large families.

European Immigrants

Newcomers to the British colonies came not only from England, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland, but also from western and central Europe. Many immigrants,
most of whom were Protestants, came from the kingdom of France and various
German-speaking states. Many were fleeing religious persecution and wars,
while others were searching for economic opportunity as farmers, artisans,
or merchants. Most immigrants settled in the middle colonies (Pennsylvania,
New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Delaware) and on the western frontier

of the southern colonies (Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia). Few headed for
New England where land was limited and Puritans dominated.

English Settlers from England continued to come to the American
colonies. However, with fewer problems at home, their numbers were relatively
small.

Germans ‘This group settled chiefly on the farmlands west of Philadelphia,
an area that became known as Pennsylvania Dutch country, They maintained
their German language, customs, and religious beliefs as Lutherans, Amish,
Brethren, or Mennonites. They obeyed colonial laws but took little interest in
English politics, By 1775, people of German stock comprised 6 percent of the
colonial population.

Scotch-Irish These English-speaking people were Protestants who came
from northern Ireland. Their ancestors had moved to Ireland from Scotland,
and they were known as the Scotch-Irish or Scots-Irish. They had little respect
for the British, who had pressured them to leave Ireland. Most settled along
the frontier in western Pennsylvania, Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia, By
1775, they comprised 7 percent of the population,

Other Europeans Other groups included French Protestants (known as
Huguenots), the Dutch, and the Swedes. These groups made up 5 percent of
the population.

Enslaved Africans

‘The largest single group of people entering the English colonies did not come
to America by choice. They were Africans who had been taken captive, forced
onto European ships, and sold as enslaved laborers. They worked a range of
occupations, such as laborer, bricklayer, or blacksmith, but the most common
work was as field laborers on plantations. By 1775, African Americans (enslaved
and free) made up 20 percent of the colonial population. Most lived in the
southern colonies, and enslaved people formed a majority of the population in
South Carolina and Georgia.

A few Africans obtained their freedom. They were either emancipated
by their owner or allowed to work for money and to purchase their freedom.
However, every colony passed laws that discriminated against African
Americans.

American Indians

Colonial population growth created conflicts between settlers and American
Indians already living in a region. Some American Indians formed alliances to
protect their land, such as the Powhaten Confederation in Virginia and the
Iroquois Confederation in the Great Lakes region. Others used European
settlers as allies in their conflicts with rival tribes. Among the most peaceful
relations between American Indians and settlers were those in Pennsylvania.
William Penn often obtained land through treaties rather than violence.

The Structure of Colonial Society

Each of the 13 British colonies developed distinct patterns of life. However, they
all also shared a number of characteristics. For example, most of the population
was English in origin, language, and tradition. In all colonies, both Africans
and non-English immigrants brought diverse influences that modified the
culture of the majority in significant ways.

Liberty and Opportunity

The colonies also offered people more self-determination than they found in
Europe. This was evident in both religion and the economy.

Religious Toleration All of the colonies permitted the practice of
different religions, but with varying degrees of freedom. Massachusetts, the
most restrictive, accepted several types of Protestants, but it excluded Roman
Catholics and all non-Christians. Rhode Island and Pennsylvania were the
most open, Pennsylvania accepted all who believed in God, including Jews.
However, only Christians could participate in government.

No Hereditary Aristocracy The extremes of Europe, with very wealthy
nobility and masses of hungry poor, were missing in the colonies. A narrower
class system, based on economics, was developing. Wealthy landowners were at
the top; craft workers and small farmers made up the majority of people.

Social Mobility In all colonies, White residents had an opportunity to
improve their standard of living and status by hard work. Acquiring land was
much easier than in Europe.

The Family

The family was the center of colonial life. With an expanding economy and
ample food supply, people married younger and reared more children than in
Europe. More than 90 percent of the people lived on farms. While life was hard,
most colonists had a higher standard of living than did most Europeans.

Men Besides working as farmers or artisans, men could own property and
participate in politics. The law gave the husband almost unlimited power in the
home, including the right to beat his wife.

< 65/809 >

Women A colonial woman bore an average of eight children, many
of whom would die at birth or in infancy. She performed multiple tasks
including cooking, cleaning, making clothes, providing medical care, and
educating children. She often worked next to her husband in the shop, on the
plantation, or on the farm. Divorce was legal but rare, and women had limited
legal and political rights. Yet the shared labors and mutual dependence with
their husbands gave most women protection from abuse and an active role in
decision making,

The Economy

By the 1750s, half of Britain's world trade was with its American colonies.
The government limited colonial manufacturing, such as making textiles. The
rich American land and British mercantilist policy produced colonies almost
entirely engaged in agriculture, forestry, and fishing.

As communities grew, more people became ministers, lawyers, doctors, and
teachers. ‘The quickest route to wealth was land, although regional geography
often provided distinct opportunities for hardworking colonists,

New England Rocky soil and long winters limited most people to
subsistence farming, producing just enough for the family. Most farms were
small—less than 100 acres—and work was done by family and an occasional
hired laborer. The descendants of the Puritans profited from logging,
shipbuilding, fishing, trading, and rum-distilling.

Middle Colonies Rich soil produced an abundance of wheat and corn for
export to Europe and the West Indies. Farms of up to 200 acres were common.
Often indentured servants and hired laborers worked with the farm families.
A variety of small manufacturing efforts developed, including iron-making.
Trading led to the growth of cities such as Philadelphia and New York. In 1750,
Philadelphia was the largest city in the colonies, with a population of about
25,000 people.

Southern Colonies Because of the diverse geography and climate in these
colonies, agriculture varied greatly. Most people lived on small subsistence
family farms without slaves. A few lived on large plantations of more than 2,000
acres relying on slave labor. Colonial plantations were self-sufficient, growing
their own food and using enslaved craftworkers. Products were tobacco in the
Chesapeake and North Carolina colonies, timber and naval stores (tar and
pitch) in the Carolinas, and rice and indigo in South Carolina and Georgia.
Most plantations were located on rivers so they could ship exports to Europe.

Monetary System One way the British controlled the colonial economy
was to limit the use of money. These limits forced colonies to use their limited
gold and silver to pay for British imports that exceeded the value of colonial
exports. To provide currency for domestic trade, many colonies issued paper
money. However, they often issued too much money, causing it to decline in
value, a process called inflation. The British government also claimed the right
+ veto any colonial laws that might harm British merchants.

66 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP” EDITION
Transportation Transporting goods by water was easier than over land
on poor roads. Trading centers such as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
Charleston were located on the sites of good harbors and navigable rivers.
Gradually overland travel by horse and stagecoach became more common in
the 18th century. Taverns provided food and lodging for travelers and served as
social centers where people exchanged news and discussed politics. By the mid-
18th century, the colonies ran a postal system using horses and small ships.

Religion
Most colonists were Protestants, but each region had some religious diversity:

+ In New England, most people were Congregationalists (Puritans) or
Presbyterians.

« In New York, people of Dutch descent often attended the Reformed
Church. Most others belonged to the Church of England and were
known as Anglicans (and later, Episcopalians).

+ In Pennsylvania, Lutherans, Mennonites, and Quakers were common,

« In Virginia and other southern colonies, Anglicans were dominant.
Maryland included many Catholics and some Jews.

Challenges Each religious group, even the Protestants who dominated,
faced problems. Jews, Catholics, and Quakers suffered from intense
discrimination, Congregationalist ministers were criticized as domineering.
Many people resented the Church of England and saw it as a symbol of English
control because it was headed by the king.

Established Churches In the 17th century, most colonial governments
taxed the people to support a particular Protestant denomination, an
established church. As various immigrants increased the religious diversity,
governments gradually reduced their support of churches. However, some
direct tax support of some New England churches remained until the 1830s.

The Great Awakening

By the early 18th century, sermons in Protestant churches tended to portray
God as the creator of a perfect universe. Ministers gave less emphasis than
their ancestors to human sinfulness and damnation, In the 1730s and 1740s,
however, a dramatic change swept the colonies. This was the Great Awakening,
a movement of fervent expressions of religious feeling among the masses.

Jonathan Edwards Among the best-known leaders of the Great
Awakening was a Congregational minister from Massachusetts, Reverend
Jonathan Edwards. When he first gave his sermon “Sinners in the Hands of an
Angry God” to his own congregation, it excited little emotion. However, as he
traveled and delivered it elsewhere it generated a fervent response. Invoking the
vivid language of the Old Testament, Edwards presented a God that was angry
with human sinfulness. Individuals who deeply repented would be saved, but
those who ignored God’s commandments would suffer eternal damnation.

George Whitefield Beginning in 1739, George Whitefield spread the
Great Awakening throughout the colonies, attracting audiences of 10,000
people. In barns, tents, and fields, he stressed that God was all-powerful and
would save only those who openly professed belief in Jesus Christ. Those who
did not would be damned to hell. Whitefield taught that ordinary people with
faith and sincerity could understand the gospels without ministers to lead
them.

Religious Impact The Great Awakening had a profound effect on religious
practice. As sinners confessed their guilt and then joyously exulted in accepting
salvation, emotionalism became more common in Protestant services. This
caused splits in some denominations, such as the Congregationalists and
Presbyterians, between supporters (“New Lights”) and opponents (“Old Lights”)
of the new expressiveness of feeling. As people studied the Bible in their homes,
ministers lost some authority over them, As a consequence, evangelical sects
such as the Baptists and Methodists that often relied on traveling ministers
attracted large numbers of new members. As the Great Awakening spread, new
denominations challenged the Congregationalists and Anglicans. One result
was that people called for stricter separation of church and state.

Political Influence The Great Awakening was one of the first common
experiences shared by colonists as Americans, It had a democratizing effect by
changing the way people viewed authority. If people made their own religious
decisions without the “higher” authority of ministers, then could they also make
their own political decisions without deferring to others? This revolutionary
idea was not expressed in the 1740s, but 30 years later it would challenge the
authority of a king and his royal governors.

Cultural Life

In the early 1600s, the chief concern of most colonists was survival. However,
100 years later, the colonial population had grown enough that the arts
could flourish, at least among the well-to-do southern planters and northern
merchants.

Achievements in the Arts and Sciences

In the coastal areas, as fear of American Indians faded, people displayed their
prosperity by adopting architectural and decorative styles from England.

Architecture The Georgian style of London was widely imitated in
houses, churches, and public buildings. Brick and stucco homes were built in
this style along the eastern seaboard. On the frontier, a one-room log cabin was
the common shelter,

Painting Many colonial painters were itinerant artists who traveled the
country in search of families who wanted their portraits painted. Shortly before
the Revolution, two American artists, Benjamin West and John Copley, went
to England where they established themselves as prominent artists.

68 UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
Literature With only a few printing facilities available, most authors wrote
on serious subjects, chiefly religion and politics in the 18th century. These
authors included Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards on religion. Political
writings highlighting the conflict between American rights and English
authority came from John Adams, James Otis, John Dickinson, Thomas Paine,
and Thomas Jefferson, among others. The most popular writer was Benjamin
Franklin. His witty aphorisms and advice were collected in Poor Richard’s
Almanack, a best-selling book that was annually revised from 1732 to 1757.

The lack of support for fiction and poetry did not stop everyone. Phillis
Wheatley was born in West Africa, enslaved, and living in Boston when she
published a collection of her poems in 1773. She was freed soon after this. Her
work is noteworthy both for her triumph over slavery and the quality of her
verse, Charles Brockden Brown, a Quaker who was born in Philadelphia in
1771, was one of the first novelists to set his stories in North America.

Science Most scientists, such as the botanist John Bartram of Philadelphia,
were self-taught. Benjamin Franklin won fame for his work with electricity and
his developments of bifocal eyeglasses and the Franklin stove.

Education

Basic education was limited and varied among the colonies, Formal efforts
were directed to males, since females were trained only for household work.

Elementary Education In New England, the Puritans’ emphasis on
reading the Bible led them to create the first tax-supported schools, A
Massachusetts law in 1647 required towns to establish primary schools for
boys. In the middle colonies, schools were either church-sponsored or private.
In the southern colonies, parents gave their children whatever education they
could. On plantations, tutors provided instruction for the owners’ children.

Higher Education The first colonial colleges were sectarian, promoting
the doctrines of a particular religious group. The Puritans founded Harvard in
1636 to prepare ministers. The Anglicans opened William and Mary in Virginia
in 1694, and the Congregationalists started Yale in Connecticut in 1701.
During this period the only nonsectarian college founded was the College of
Philadelphia. Founded in 1765, it later became the University of Pennsylvania.
Benjamin Franklin was among its founders.

Ministry During the 17th century, the Christian ministry was the only
profession to enjoy widespread respect among the common people, Ministers
were often the only well-educated people in a small community.

Physicians Colonists who fell prey to epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria
were often treated by “cures” that only made them worse. A doctor's training
was as an apprentice to an experienced physician. The first medical college was
begun in 1765 as part of Franklin's idea for the College of Philadelphia.

Lawyers During the 1700s, as trade expanded and legal problems became
more complex, people felt a need for expert assistance in court. The most able

69

TOPIC 2.7 COLONIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURE

< 69/809 >

lawyers formed a bar (committee or board), which set rules and standards
for young lawyers. Lawyers gained respect in the 1760s and 1770s when they
argued for colonial rights, John Adams, James Otis, and Patrick Henry were
lawyers whose legal arguments would ultimately provide the intellectual
underpinnings of the American Revolution.

The Press
News spread mainly through a postal system and local printing firms.

Newspapers By 1776, there were more than 40 newspapers issued weekly
in the colonies, They provided month-old news from Europe, various ads for
goods and services and for the return of runaway indentured servants and
enslaved people, and pious essays giving advice for better living.

The Zenger Case Newspaper printers in colonial days ran the risk of being
jailed for libel if any article offended the authorities. English common law at the
time stated that it was a crime to criticize the governor, no matter whether the
criticism was true or false, In 1735, John Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,
was tried on a charge of libelously criticizing New York's royal governor.
Zenger’s lawyer, Andrew Hamilton, argued that his client had printed the truth.
Ignoring the law, the jury acquitted Zenger. While this case did not guarantee
freedom of the press, it encouraged newspapers to criticize the government.

The Enlightenment

In the 18th century, some educated Americans felt attracted to a European
movement in literature and philosophy known as the Enlightenment. The
leaders of this movement believed that the recent past was a “dark” era in which
people relied too much on tradition and God's intervention in human life. They
believed that the “light” of reason could solve most of humanity's problems.

A major influence on the Enlightenment and American thinking was
John Locke, a 17th-century English philosopher. Locke, in his Two Treatises
of Government, reasoned that while the state (the government) is supreme, it
is bound to follow “natural laws” based on the rights that people have simply
because they are human. He argued that sovereignty ultimately resides with
the people rather than with the state, Furthermore, citizens had a right and
obligation to revolt against a government that failed to protect their rights.
Other Enlightenment philosophers adopted and expounded on Locke's
ideas, His stress on natural rights would provide a rationale for the American
Revolution and the principles of the U.S. Constitution.

The Colonial Relationship with Britain

For all their diversity, in some ways, the colonies were becoming more like
England. They built on English political traditions to develop self-governing
local communities. Most colonists spoke English and could read the books and
newspapers in the colonies. Many had commercial ties with England, either
exporting tobacco or importing manufactured goods. Most colonists, including
Puritans, Quakers, and Anglicans, were connected to England by religion.

0) UNITED STATES HISTORY: AP’ EDITION
Colonial Identity At the same time, the colonists were developing a
distinctly American viewpoint and way of life. Their motivations for leaving
Europe, the English political heritage, the diverse mixture of people, the
emergence of writers and painters, and the influence of the American natural
environment combined to create a culture unlike any in Europe. The colonists
—especially White male property owners—exercised the rights of free speech
and a free press, became accustomed to electing representatives to colonial
assemblies, and tolerated a variety of religions. Observers were beginning to
think of Americans as restless, enterprising, practical, and forever seeking to
improve their circumstances.

Mistrust of the British Development of a colonial identity reflected
diverging interests between the colonies and Great Britain, Colonists were
eager to push westward, while the British desired peace on the frontier with
American Indians. Colonists were comfortable with salutary neglect, while
the British sometimes tried to enforce trade regulations. Colonists took pride
in governing themselves according to English traditions of liberty, while the
British claimed sovereignty over them as part of the empire. Finally, colonies
were more ethnically and religiously diverse than England, which meant that
many colonists did not identify from birth with the country that ruled them.
‘These differences would become stronger after 1763,

Politics and Government

By 1750, the colonies had similar systems of government, with a governor
as chief executive and a legislature voting to adopt or reject the governor's
proposed laws. In every colony, the legislature consisted of two houses:

+ Members of the lower house, or assembly, were elected by White male
property owners, It voted for or against new taxes. Colonists thus became
accustomed to paying taxes only if their chosen representatives approved.

« Members of the upper house in the two self-governing colonies were also
elected. In the other colonies, members were appointed by the king or
the proprietor, and were also known as the council.

+ Governors were either appointed by the crown, elected by the people
(Rhode Island and Connecticut), or appointed by a proprietor
(Pennsylvania and Maryland).

Local Government Colonists in New England established towns and
villages. In these, the local government was the town meeting in which people
would regularly come together to vote directly on public issues. In the southern
colonies, where farms and plantations were more widely separated, towns were
less common, Local government was carried on by a law-enforcing sheriff and
other officials who served a large territory called a county.

Voting If democracy is defined as the participation of all people in the
making of government policy, then colonial democracy was limited. Laws
barred most people—White women, poor White men, slaves of both sexes,
71

TOPIC 2.7 COLONIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURE

< 71/809 >

and most free Blacks—from voting. Nevertheless, the government was
beginning to remove some barriers to voting in the 18th century. In particular,
religious restrictions were declining, Property qualifications often remained,
Another variable in the development of democracy was who could serve in
the assemblies and councils. In Virginia, the House of Burgesses was restricted
to a small group of wealthy landowners. However, in Massachusetts, the
legislature was open to small farmers. Even there, the educated, propertied elite
held power for generations, The common people everywhere tended to defer to
their “betters” and depend upon the privileged few to make decisions.
Political life in the colonies was restricted to landowning White males
only. Yet, compared with Europe, the English colonies allowed greater self-
government. This made the colonial political system unusual for its time.

HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES: WAS COLONIAL SOCIETY DEMOCRATIC?

Was colonial America “democratic” or not? The question is important for its own
sake and also because it affects one’s perspective on the American Revolution
and on the subsequent evolution of democratic politics in the United States.

Democracy in Action Many historians have focused on the politics of
colonial Massachusetts. Some have concluded that colonial Massachusetts
was indeed democratic, at least for the times. By studying voting records and
statistics, they determined that the vast majority of White male citizens could
vote and were not restricted by property qualifications. According to these
historians, class differences between the elite and the masses of people did not
prevent the latter from participating fully in colonial politics.

Consensus over Conflict Other historians question whether broad voting
rights by themselves demonstrate the existence of real democracy. The true
test of democratic practice, they argue, would be whether different groups in
a colonial town felt free to debate political questions in a town meeting. In the
records of such meetings, they found little evidence of true political conflict
and debate. Instead, they found that the purpose of town meetings in colonial
days was to reach a consensus and to avoid conflict and real choices, These
historians believe that consensus-forming limited the degree of democracy,

The Maritime Elite A third historical perspective is based on studies of
economic change in colonial Boston. According to this view, a fundamental
shift from an agrarian to a maritime economy occurred in the 18th century.
In the process, a new elite emerged to dominate Boston’s finances, society, and
politics, The power of this elite prevented colonial Massachusetts from being
considered a true democracy.

The question remains: To what extent were Massachusetts and the other
colonies democratic? The answer depends on the definition of democracy.

in the British colonies,

Comparisons in Period 2

Learning Objective: Compare the effects of the development of colonial
society in the various regions of North America.

The reasoning skill of “comparison” is the suggested focus for evaluating the
content of this period. Historians often compare various European colonial
systems or various British colonies. As explained in Topic 2.1, there are many
factors to consider in the broad topic of the influences on the development
of society in the 13 colonies from 1607 to 1754. On the AP exam, a question
might be focused on any one factor such as migration, the North American
environment, interaction with Native Americans, or British expectations to list
but a few of the factors.

In an effort to “Explain the extent to which the British colonies were
involved in political, cultural, and economic exchanges with Great Britain,”
one could show that from the very beginning the colonialists questioned the
British government's control while asking for their support and mirroring
much of their culture.

One could show that, economically, the British policy of mercantilism
dictated what the colonies could produce and with whom they could trade.
This is specific evidence of an economic factor that negated colonial use of all
their available resources that produced “enumerated” goods. One can take other
specific evidence to demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between
Britain and the colonies. For example, one could compare the colonial desire
for government support to drive away the Native Americans to the colonial
view of mercantilism.

Further evidence can support the argument that in the 17th century the
colonies had an evolving relationship with Britain. One element that could
be compared is religion. How did the influence of the British-led Church of
England compare with that of the Puritans, Quakers, and Catholics who played
active roles in starting specific colonies? One might consider several plausible
arguments and then decide which one is best supported by the evidence:

+ Colonial culture was more tolerant of religious diversity than was
British culture.

« People in the colonies carried on the same religious conflicts that
existed in Great Britain.

+ Colonists held similar ideas about religious toleration as the British did,
but circumstances led them to act more tolerantly.
